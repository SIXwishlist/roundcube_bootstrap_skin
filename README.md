# roundcube_bootstrap_skin
========================

A roundcube mobile-first skin, based on twitter bootstrap 3

This skin is intended to combine the power of roundcube, an open source webmail client, and twitter boostrap, a mobile-first css framework.

At the moment this skin is under heavy development and should not be used in production AT ALL!

However, I'm looking for contributors and fellow bootstrap and roundcube fans who are looking for a bootstrap skin but didn't find one yet.

Contact me, if you want to participate in this project!
